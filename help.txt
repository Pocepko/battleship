                      Rules                       
The objective of Battleship is to sink all of your
opponent's ships before they sink yours.          
                                                  
Each player is given a 10x10 grid. Players arrange
their fleet of ships on their grid without letting
their opponent see the placement. The fleet       
consists of the following ships:                  
 1 Carrier     (4 squares)                        
 2 Battleship  (3 squares)                        
 3 Cruiser     (2 squares)                        
 4 Submarine   (1 square)                         
                                                  
Players take turns calling out coordinates on the 
opponent's grid to try to locate their ships.     
Coordinates are specified by a letter (A-J) and a 
number (1-10). For example, "A3" or "G7".         
                                                  
If a player's guess lands on a square occupied by 
an opponent's ship, it's a hit. If the guess lands
on an empty square, it's a miss. Hits and misses  
are marked on a separate tracking grid to keep    
track of each player's guesses.                   
                                                  
When all squares of a ship are hit, it is         
considered sunk. Once all of a player's ships are 
sunk, they lose the game.                         
                                                  
The game ends when one player has successfully    
sunk all of their opponent's ships. That player   
is declared the winner.
